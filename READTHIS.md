My D3 customer flow chart consists of interactive design.
It shows actions certain departments can do
First you log in - this log in line is dotted because it starts the sequence
Then you start windows following the green lines that coordinate after starting windows
Whoever you log in as you have options to do the following for whoever you are
Those deparments are linked with grey lines to avaible actions

Begining of my HTML file i created my properties by setting link sizes, text attributes, circle sizes/attributes

I use my D3 selectors to select my body and and create nodes witch each function
my other functions are used to set click drag events to set coordinates dragged to into those X and Y positions
After each srouce is written out the methods take care of creating the path circle and text associated with my data
