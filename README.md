Hieu Pham Final App

Application Overview

-My application mostly use Dynamics.spring methods and there are 7 steps.

First: The button is the combination of many code that I can barely understand. I used the example from Dynamicsjs.com to built this button. The animation is using spring methods that make the button popping out of the screen.

Second: After the button clicked, I used spring method to move the smiley icon to the top. Also I hide the button.

Third: I closed the gate so the icon doesn't fall down. Then, I used spring method again to make it look like the icon move forward then backward like he is mad.

Fourth: When the spring stopped, I opened another gate and the icon fall down and bouncing using forceQithGravity method.

Fifth: After the boucing stopped, the icon then move slowly forward and stop when it hit the wall. This is using inline method.

Sixth and seventh: I know he mad! I used easeIn and easeOut to create a loop. The icon now is moving from the right wall to the left wall for infinite times. I also added the scaling attribute to change the icon size.
