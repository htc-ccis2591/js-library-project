Leaflet is a javascript library that uses vector data to dynamically zoom in and out of any image. It is especially useful with maps. 




# js-library-project
For this assignment each student will learn to use a different JavaScript library and create a sample project that shows it's features.

You should select two JavaScript libraries that you are interested in and email those selections to the instructor, who will send out a list with the final library selection for each student.

## Goals:

- Learn about a new JavaScript library through documentation and information available on the web.
- Use that library to make a sample application that shows it's use.
- Use JavaScript & HTML/CSS coding best practices in the creation of your application
- Show and present your work to the class through an Ignite style presentation


## GitHub Repository
https://github.com/htc-ccis2591/js-library-project/

As usual you will need to fork and clone this repository to begin the assignment, and submit a pull request for grading when the assignment is complete.  


## Study the Library
You will need to submit a 1-2 page paper (~750 words) that gives an overview of the library you have chosen and how it is used.  This should be organized to include an introduction and closing, and should be proof-read for good grammar, spelling and sentence structure.  

You should include information on:

- The name of the library and it's purpose
- A link to their website
- An overview of the main library features
- Information on how to include the library in a project
- Information on any dependencies the library has (other libraries it needs to function)
- An example of how to use the library


## Build an Application
Once you are familiar with the library, you'll want to apply what you've learned to build a sample application.  This application should show off the main features of the library.  Exactly what it does will be dependent on the library selected and your interests.  Typically I would expect to see 4-6 library methods used, but this can vary based on the purpose of your library and your application.

You will need to build a web page from scratch and add enough styling to the page that it looks presentable, however the main focus of the assignment is the JavaScript code and behavior.


### Application Overview
You will also need to include a README.md file with your project that discusses how you used the library in your project.  This should clearly call out the features of the library you used.  The best way to do this is with code snippets and/or screen shots. You can include HTML tags in your README.md file to add images, just make sure to upload those images to GitHub with your project.  Code highlighting can be done as described in [GitHub Help - Creating and highlighting code blocks ](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).


## Tips
- Be sure to use all of the JavaScript coding best practices that we have discussed.
- Make and use functions; try to keep them small, don’t make long unreadable monster code.
- Watch the scope of your variables.  Keep things to as small a scope as possible.
- Consider using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to get a quick edge on your page layout.
- Don't go wild with fonts and colors, but do make the page interesting.  [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) and [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) can help.


## Presentation
The project presentation will be done [Ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) style.  You will put together 20 slides, and set them up to automatically advance every 15 seconds for a 5 minute presentation. This is intended to create fast and fun presentation, which overviews your project and library choice __quickly__.  You will not be able to cover all of the details in a presentation of this length, but you might also be surprised how much you can say if you organize it well.

Your first and last slides should be intro & close and expect them to be "wasted" in the sense of saying anything important.  Just aim to get who you are and what your library is out on the first slide.  The end slide can easily get run over if you talk more or slower than you expect too, so just remind people of who you are and where they can find more information on your project - GitHub info.

The remaining slide content is up to you, but you'll find that in 15 seconds, only a few words can be read.  So use large fonts for any text and keep it really, really short.  Communicate the information in your *talk* not your slides. Let the slides be more of a background illustration.    

The better presentations tend to tell a story, so your story here is your application and learning experience. The presentation shouldn't aim to be deeply technical, just touch the surface and focus on the experience of learning and building the application.  This is however just a suggestion.  You have total freedom here in how you shape your presentation.

Check out some of the presentations from the [Ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) web site to get a feel for how different things have been presented. These talks tend to be less technical overall, so be careful not to dive too deep.
